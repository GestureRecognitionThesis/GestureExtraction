# Todo

### Model
- Train a model with 25, 50, and 100 of each video
    - This need to be done with coordinates, graphs, and a combination (9 total models)
- Create 20 of each video for validation testing
- Measure the accuracy of each model
- Measure the loss of each model
- Measure the F1 score of each.
  - Measure the precision of each.
  - Measure the recall of each.

### API
- Create an endpoint for each of the three models
  - Make it possible to change between the 25, 50 and 100 model
- Measure the time it takes to make a prediction
- Measure the resources used to make a prediction
- Do load testing using locust
- If time permits
  - Implement jaeger tracing in order to locate bottlenecks (could be done the week before the exam)

### Frontend
- Create a simple frontend application that shows the use of the API. This could be for example be a simple chat
